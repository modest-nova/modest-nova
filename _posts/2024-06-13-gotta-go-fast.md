# gotta go fast

i gave myself 2 days to set up the server  
for our new project, then test it to see if it works.  
i finished the server and confirmation in 4 hours.  

this sounds good, but i was so motivated for the challenge,  
and once it was over so quickly, i felt bored  
for the rest of the day.  

ultimately i guess i overestimated how hard it is  
to set up a server for an app. it was easy.
