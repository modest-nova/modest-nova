# comipura

today i had my last appointment with comipura.  
they are a drainage company in fukuoka.  
i have handled their network and IT solutions for 3 years.  
at first, i was nervous as a foreigner, as they  
foster a very traditional japanese corporate environment.  

after the first year or so, the "senmu" - the mother of the CEO,  
warmed to me, and became like a grandmother figure.  
i often made a point of greeting her personally,  
and i think she appreciated that.  
she gave me a wedding gift - some fancy kelp to make broth.  

i will make sure to visit every once in a while.  
thank you comipura!
