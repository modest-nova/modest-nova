# stop start

i am still getting used to my new department.  
having additional meetings in the evening is new, but helpful.  
having to wait for my busy boss to check things  
before proceeding with my work is challenging.  

i was used to having full responsibility for my decisions,  
whereas now this is less clear, and i ask for permission more.  
this can be frustrating, but also encourages me to make sure  
that i am well prepared when i ask questions and share info.
