# first words of aicc

today we ran some test calls for my call center automation project.  
it went very well. it handled positive and negative calls correctly.  
there are some aspects to polish on the infra side,  
but on the ai side, everything is pretty much in order.  
  
i felt a lot of responsibility in leading the ai front  
for this project, and to see it work out is very fulfilling.  
  
next week we will launch the beta for rakuroku internally.  
if that goes well too, i'll be delighted.
