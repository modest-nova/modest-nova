# nutcase

it is interesting to experience the range of emotions  
associated with creating and starting to release a product.  
the things you can see so clearly as ideas are revealed to  
contain many more complications than envisaged.  
  
isn't that fun? that there is more than you initially thought?  
even if it is more problems. more features. more requirements.  
there is more than meets the eye. more to see, more to do.  
more to learn. this is fun!  
  
i didn't think i was nervous for the presentation,  
but my voice was not confident. i believe what i said,  
but there is a gap, and i wonder where that came from.
