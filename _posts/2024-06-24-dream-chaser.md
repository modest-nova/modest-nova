# dream chaser

i think the use of kanji in japanese names is beautiful  
there are so many ways to give meaning to a name  
the symbol meaning, the number of strokes, component parts..  
  
i have met "universe", "dream chaser", "become the ocean",  
and i am just "tom". i don't hate my name, though!
