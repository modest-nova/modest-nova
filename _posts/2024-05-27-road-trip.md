# road trip

i took a trip to kirishima with my wife  
and her family this weekend.  
it was very nice. i think there is a real, deep  
value in getting everybody together, regularly.  

in some ways the modern world alienates us from our family.  
we should actively guard against that in our individual lives.  
it was a very warm weekend.  

also, onsen → sauna → ice bath is a divine cycle.
