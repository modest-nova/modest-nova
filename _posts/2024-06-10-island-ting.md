# island ting

i took some time off work to visit miyakojima.  
i went with my wife, her friend, and her friend's husband.  
we had a very good time. we drank a lot of alcohol.  
i saw a sea turtle and a sea snake right outside our villa.  
it was great to feel closer to nature and wildlife.  
  
we went skinny dipping at midnight  
whilst drinking and playing music.  
like university students at 30.
