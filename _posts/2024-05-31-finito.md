# finito

i started working with the office doctor team in summer 2021.  
it was a little intimidating to visit so many companies,  
but once i got used to it, it was a lot of fun.  
  
my boss was a good boss.  
my team was a good team.  
i learned a lot about PCs, networks, and japan.  
  
it feels like i am saying goodbye, but actually  
my desk and seat will be the same.  
my wider department will even be the same.  
i am telling myself it is a significant change,  
to motivate myself to perform well from next week.  
  
ultimately the stories we tell ourselves define how we operate.  
i truly believe in high agency.  
i think the average level of agency in this country is low,  
but i don't have to tell myself that story.
